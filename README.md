of the transactions has been made.
•	It is an expanding ledger that is growing vigorously and storing the transactions.
•	It provides various benefits such as data transparency, a very huge amount of
Security, verifiability, etc.
•	There is no any the one centralized person present here to look at the transactions.
So, the major issue that is trusting on third party is removed from block chain.
•	It allows only two operations on data from CRUD i.e. create and read. No one can

Connected to each other consisting of block number, transactions, previous
Block’s security key and the mining key.

2) What is the core problem Block chain is going to solve?
A. Authenticity
B. Security
C. Decentralization
D. There is no data loss or manipulation.
E. Need of powerful third party for trust.

3) What are the few features of blockchain you will give?
Ans: There are some main features of blockchain:

B. Verifiable
C. Immutable

Q.4 What all things Block contains?
Ans: Block contains
A. Block Number
B. Transaction records
C. Previous Block fingerprint


5) How the verifiability of the blockchain is being attained?
